Hello and welcome to my 4-month long, one-man project called TerraScape! 
In short, it's a mod dedicated to recreating content from the 2007 OldSchool RuneScape servers in Terraria. 
One of the goals of this mod is to provide balanced and fun game mechanics to add to your ordinary Terraria experience.

Version 1.1 is here, bringing you Clue Scrolls!
Read the forum post for details.

NOTICE: The Mod Browser version does not have custom boss music, as it turned out to be a problem. For the full experience, download the mod from the forum page

Current content includes:
Total of 378 items
64 Weapons (17 Melee, 9 Ranged, 37 Magic and 1 throwing)
13 Armor sets + multiple vanity items
20 Enemies
10 Bosses
One new ore
