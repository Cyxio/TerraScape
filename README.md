# TerraScape
TerraScape, a mod for Terraria using tModLoader

This repository hosts the (almost) up-to-date source code for my TerraScape mod.
As development has been slow for a while, this repository is not currently updated to the latest version, as the source code resides within a different computer of mine.
This repo will be updated once development continues at a normal rate.

Meanwhile, feel free to stop by at the [mod discord](https://discord.gg/CDfdk3Y) if you have any comments or suggestions, they are greatly appreciated!

## Mod description
Hello and welcome to my 4-month long, one-man project called TerraScape! 
In short, it's a mod dedicated to recreating content from the 2007 OldSchool RuneScape servers in Terraria. 
One of the goals of this mod is to provide balanced and fun game mechanics to add to your ordinary Terraria experience.

Version 1.2.1 updates:
Updated to tModLoader v0.11.6.1
A new feature: Slayer!
Added 5 different slayer masters, enchanted gem, skip token, pack of potions, pack of healing potions (also greater variant) & bacon pack.
4 new bosses, based on the superior slayer monsters.
New endgame melee weapons: Armadyl, Bandos, Saradomin & Zamorak godswords and the Saradomin Sword. These are currently obtained from the slayer shop, they will be moved to the God Wars if such update will be released. (no promises yet)
